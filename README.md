## Why I Created this Project
I created this project to simplify the process of the getting your local weather without having to forego your privacy in the process (ip tracking, logging etc). I was inspired to create this project as a way to get my feet wet in the realm of web development. Futhermore, I built this to solve my own personal problem of wanting a lightweight, bloat-free, and fast weather app which is exactly what I did with the help of the Progressive Web App technology.

## Technologies Used
- üç∞ Vanilla JS for fetching weather information
- ‚òÅÔ∏è OpenWeatherAPI for up-to-date weather information
- üì± Progressive Web App for a mobile-friendly experience

## Features
- User can select measurement unit to display info in
- Works with ***all*** cities and countries in the world
- Displays current temperature and humidex
- Displays wind information
- Displays sunrise and sunset times
- This website uses **cookies** to remember the user's selected city, this information is only stored locally

Clone the repository and then run the following commands in the directory:
```bash
